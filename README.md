# NetCoreStarterApp

## Overview

This repository contains a sample .net core application with React and Webpack.

## Requirements

I have only tested this with the following software/environments:

* .net core version 1.1
* Webpack 2.2.1
* React 15.4.2
* node.js 6.9.5
* Windows 10 Pro 14393.693
* Visual Studio 2017 RC 4

## Get Started

Before getting started, you need to ensure that the karma-cli is installed globally:

`npm install -g karma-cli`

This will enable you to run `karma start` to run the unit tests.

Here will be some instructions for getting started or whatever. In the meantime, just run using Visual Studio.
